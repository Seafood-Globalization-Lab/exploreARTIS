\arguments{
\item{data}{an ARTIS dataframe.}

\item{prop_flow_cutoff}{default prop_flow_cutoff = 0.05 means trade volumes that comprise less than 5\% of the total trade are lumped together as "Other".}

\item{species}{list of species/species groups to include, default NA - includes all species.}

\item{years}{list of years to include, default NA - includes all years.}

\item{producers}{list of producers (as iso3 codes) to include, default NA - includes all producers.}

\item{exporters}{list of exporters (as iso3 codes) to include, default NA - includes all exporters.}

\item{importers}{list of importers (as iso3 codes) to include, default NA - includes all importers.}

\item{hs_codes}{list of hs level 6 codes to include, default NA - includes all hs6 codes.}

\item{prod_method}{list of production methods (capture, aquaculture, or unknown), default NA - includes all production methods.}

\item{prod_environment}{list of environments (marine, inland, or unknown), default NA - includes all environments}

\item{export_source}{list of types of export (domestic export, foreign export, or error export), default NA - all export sources.}

\item{weight}{trade quantity type to visualize ("live" for live weight or "product" for product weight), default "live."}
